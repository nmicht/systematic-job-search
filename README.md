# Systematic job search

This repository is a template to help you stay focused with a systematic job search approach.

_Example of usage: I use a repository like this with a branch for each year I have done a job search. I like to keep everything in one place with an easy way to see evolution of my answers._

## Why and what

_think about why I'm looking for a job, what type of job, what will make me happy, what is a no-no, etc_

_Describe the three things that are most important for you in your next position_

## OKRs

## Process

1. Prep
   1. Think about why I'm looking for a job. This goes in the README in the first section
   1. Think about the type of companies I would like to work, type of projects, teams, culture and everything that makes a job interesting. Define a ranking system for it and configure it in the [spreadsheet tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_w2W2ZdGwqK5nIuYSvIiPFztnPOjB1v1qNyJYimu2Ys/edit#gid=0).
   1. Work on improving my presence as a candidate. Update LinkedIn and other social media like GitHub. Work on a generic Resume and set aside folders for targeted resumes for each company.
   1. Think about the salary I would like to get and how the market is. This goes in90 the [salary file](salary.md) 
   1. Do thorough preparation for the interviews. Check the [behavioral prep folder](prep-behavioral) for general interviews.
   2. Study and prepare for technical interviews.   
2. Search
   1. Block a specific time of the day to search for jobs on LinkedIn and other platforms. The findings should be registered in the [spreadsheet tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_w2W2ZdGwqK5nIuYSvIiPFztnPOjB1v1qNyJYimu2Ys/edit#gid=0). Don't forget to download the job ads and save them in a folder.
   2. Block one to two times weekly to work on targeted cover letters to apply for the jobs.
3. Interview
   1. Once a company invites you to an interview, create a markdown file using the [template](interviews/template.md) in the interviews folder and fill in the information.
   2. Prepare for interviews by reading about the company and the role, building a pitch, and preparing at least three questions for the interviewer. You can use some of the questions in [to ask file](interviews/to-ask.md).
   3. When sharing availability, push for weeks where all interviews are similar. For example, try to have all screenings with recruiters in the same week.
4. Keep focus
   1. Every day, review the [tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gKXTja1VcNgjIWf87lD8t9K1BScISh3DsCu_0Ezzics), update and take action on any activity needed like follow-ups, prepare for interviews, send availability, etc
   2. At every start of the week, collect metrics in the [spreadsheet tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gKXTja1VcNgjIWf87lD8t9K1BScISh3DsCu_0Ezzics) and score OKRs
